# UFOs

## The Purpose
Via JavaScript, Bootstrap, and HTML formatting, a custom website was previously created that shows information for UFO sightings all over the world. The information was filtered with a date and then shows all the city, state, country, shape of UFO, and duration of time the UFO was seen. Because the information being presented is city, state, country, shape of UFO, and duration of time the filter search was than extended to filter through these criteria. In order to do this variables and a forEach() function were created so the data in the array could be properly filtered and if-else statements were also used to achieve this goal.

## How to Use
Although the data provided is fairly limited, the filter search is still helpful. Pick a date, city, country,  or common UFO shape and enter it into the appropriate search. To fit the appropriate format of the search examples are present before you enter a search.

For an example lets pick the most popular state: New Mexico. By entering an abbreviated state and then hitting enter you can easily find all the data connected to New Mexico.

## Drawbacks and Recommendations
While this search filter is a great idea, the data provided is very limited. A drawback is that the search entries are also very limited. The data only provides information for one country, the USA and not every state or city. To fix this:

1. The country filter should just be removed entirely unless more data is entered from another country that is not the USA. 

2. In general, there needs to be more information gathered and entered in order to search through.

3. Because information of UFO Sightings is only gathered from the USA, and not every state, providing a list of states so users know what information is available per state would help the search go smoother.
